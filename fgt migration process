Preparation

1. Confirm Firmware Compatibility

Ensure both 601E and 601F are running the same FortiOS version (e.g., 7.2.6 on both).

If not, upgrade/downgrade the target 601F unit before proceeding.



2. Download 601E Configuration

From the 601E GUI:
Dashboard > Backup & Restore > Backup Configuration

Choose unencrypted if you plan to manually edit the file.



3. Identify Interface Mappings

Make a list of physical interface names on both models (e.g., port1 on 601E may not match port1 on 601F).

Run get system interface physical on both to compare.

🛠️ Configuration Conversion

1. Open the 601E config in a text editor.


2. Modify Interface Names:

Replace 601E interfaces with 601F equivalents.

Example: edit "port3" → change to edit "wan1" or correct port name on 601F.



3. Remove Hardware-Specific Entries (optional but recommended):

Delete or comment out:

config system virtual-switch

config system switch-interface

config system ha (if reconfiguring HA manually)

config log settings (adjust for new device)

Any set snmp-index values specific to the old device




4. Check for Unsupported Features:

Features deprecated or unsupported on the new hardware should be removed.
